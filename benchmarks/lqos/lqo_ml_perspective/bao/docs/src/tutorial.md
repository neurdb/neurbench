# Bao Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll set up Bao with PostgreSQL, load the [IMDB dataset](https://git.io/imdb), and then execute a small sample workload with and without Bao to see the difference. Then, we'll look at how Bao's exploratory mode can be used to prevent query regressions. Finally, we will look at how Bao can be used as a query advisor.
